# Xolmis Mobile

Xolmis Mobile is designed for fieldwork, enabling researchers and citizen scientists to record ornithological data directly on their mobile devices. Collect ornithological data such as bird lists and counts, nest monitoring and collected specimens. Use it as your digital field notebook.

> This project is in the early stages of development, so expect bugs and breaking changes.
